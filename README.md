# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic game that two people can enjoy together. It is played on a 3x3 grid where players take turns placing their marks, X or O, in empty spots. The main goal is to get three of the same marks in a row-horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

How to Play the Game
The steps to play the game are listed below:

Both players choose either X or O to mark their cells.
There will be a 3x3 grid with numbers assigned to each of the 9 cells.
The player who chooses X begins to play first.
He enters the cell number where he wishes to place X.
Now, both O and X play alternatively until one of the two wins.
Winning criteria: Whenever any of the two players has fully filled one row/ column/ diagonal with their symbol (X/ O), they win and the game ends.
If neither of the two players wins, the game is said to have ended in a draw.
